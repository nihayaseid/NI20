     <h1>Adavantages of having an iphone</h1>

     <p>
        iPhone is faster than Android based phones
        In tests, iPhone takes a lead once it starts to open apps that are stored in<br>
         the background. And the faster iPhone 8 will be even faster. Apple's iPhone is 
         leading because of better hardware and software <br>
        integration and controlling both sides of the equation.
