    <h1>Disadvantage of having an samsung</h1>

    <p>
        Some disadvantages are present in samsung phone even if they are atop in android smartphones. 
        These are the details i found from my observation.<br>

1. the prior problem about samsung phone is their design language of phones.
 Most of the smartphones looks like same in design. Camera placement,
 speakers are at a same place in most of the mobiles that is little bit confusing.<br>
2. Providing RAM for memory management is crappy in samsung phones. Other 
smartphone OEM started to provide 3GB, 2GB RAM for mid range and budget price, 
samsung still providing 1GB RAM or 1.5 RAM GB. Only few devices now unveiled with 2GB RAM.<br>
3. Another thing i found in my colleague smartphone, is rarely software updates. 
Samsung is not releasing regular updates for users like Motorola and google does. 
Touchwiz UI over android OS in samsung phones is a barrier for frequent updates.<br>
4. Due to less RAM, i face performance lag while doing multitasking. I always 
clean RAM before playing game.<br>
5. Battery backup is need to be enhanced.<br>
6. Price is little bit expensive when compared with specs they offering
