     <h1>Adavantages of having an Tecno</h1>

     <p>
        Tecno has helped many to realize their dream of using a Smartphone. Before now Smart-phones
        are seen as phones for the wealthy because of their classy prices. This is no more the case
        as one can now own a Smartphone with just N10,000 (US $66). With this, buying a Smartphone
        is no longer a wish but a budget.
        
        Tecno stormed the market in 2012 with their first Smartphone, the T1, a dual-SIM phone running on 
        android OS. Since then Tecno has produced series of Smartphone all running on Android OS with
         dual-SIM features. The latest being Tecno Phantom A2, a dual-SIM Smartphone running on Android
          4.2(Jelly Bean).
        Now the question is, what are the pros and cons of using a Tecno Smartphone? Is there any big 
        difference between Tecno Smartphone and Smartphone from other manufacturers like Samsung, HTC 
        and many others? To me, Smartphone is Smartphone irrespective of the manufacturer. Though all
         smart-phones are not the same, even Tecno smart-phones are not the same, some have better 
         functions, better memory, better UI, and also the price tag differ.
        
        Advantages of Tecno Smart-phones:
        The advantages of using a Tecno Smartphone is as numerous as using any other smart-phones 
        from other manufacturers. There is no major difference in their functions when compared to 
        other smart-phones but there are some draw backs which I’m going to discuss under the 
        disadvantages of Tecno smart-phones. The peculiar advantages of using Tecno smart-phones 
        are as follows.
        
        1. Low-cost: the cheap nature of Tecno smart-phones cannot be over emphasized. Tecno
         smart-phones are quiet cheap compared to their equivalents from other manufacturers.
          For instance, the Tecno phantom A2 which have nearly the same features as Samsung 
          Galaxy S4 is about 40% the price of this smartphone.
        2.Dual-SIM: Tecno Smartphone come with dual-SIM  and both of them can be standby. 
        This feature saves you the burden of  spending extra money to buy another phone if 
        you have two sim cards. More also it is easier to travel with two sim cards in one 
        phone, saves you the stress of switching sim cards often when you have two sim cards 
        and one phone.

    <h1>Disadvantage of having an Tecno</h1>

<p>
    Disadvantages of Tecno Smart-phones:
    1. Battery: Though the battery strength of their latest release Tecno Phantom A2 is 
    relatively better,  the battery strength of tecno Smart-phones are poor. But this is 
    not strange for Android users as the battery strength of most android phones are nothing 
    to write home about. This is partly due to the fact that android OS keeps many applications 
    running in the background even after they have been close. Also there are many apps to play 
    around with which also consumes battery.  The usage determines how long the battery will 
    last.
    
    2. Future Upgrades: For now tecno has not created a means of upgrading the OS that come with
     their smart-phones. What this mean is that if you bought a Tecno smart-phone running on 
     android OS4.0 ICS, there is no inbuilt means of upgrading to android OS 4.2 JB. But when
      developers decide to develop custom OS for tecno phones then, people who root their phones 
      may benefit.
    
    3. Camera: Though some tecno smart-phones have large megapixel cameras, they are not good 
    cameras at night. During the day they take good and beautiful pictures but at night when 
    flash light is required the pictures that good compared to other smart-phones.
    
    4. RAM: The RAM(Random Access Memory) of Tecno Smart-phones are not that large compared to other smart-phones. For instance, the Teccno phantom A2 which is said to be rubbing shoulder with Samsung Galaxy s4 has 1G RAM while the S4 has 2G RAM.  It is the RAM of the any phone that determines how many applications can run simultaneously and how fast they open and many more.
    
    From what I have explained so far, you might think Tecno is for people who cannot afford the more expensive smart-phones. The truth is, despite the draw backs Tecno smart-phones are what going for. Other smart-phones also have their own pros and cons, it’s only when you have read theirs you will know. Any of them is what buying.
